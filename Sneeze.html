    <h1>Things That Make Me Sneeze:</h1>
    <p>I wanted to put together a quick list of stuff that makes me sneeze.</p>
    <p>It's because I keep forgetting to avoid this stuff, and maybe if I write it down then I'll remember it. Particular the one about sawdust</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dust</li>
        <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Doing the following:
            <ol>
                <li>Cutting some wood using a saw</li>
                <li>Forgetting to clean the dust off</li>
                <li>Looking at the cut real close in order to make sure it's alright</li>
                <li>Breathing in
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's worse when I breathe in slowly and get a real lung-full of fresh sawdust</li>
                        <li>The sawdust does smell nice, though</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The Next Funny Item</li>
        <li>The Final, Deeply Insightful Item</li>
    </ul>
